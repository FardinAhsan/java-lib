/// <summery>
/// A lot of work needs to be done here.
///  
/// What needs to be done:
///  
/// This class is ment for code that is going to do preprocesing of the image before we
/// pass it to the CFingerPrint Class.The Sample pictures need to be transformed from what they look
/// like in Sample1 to what they look like in ProcessedSample.
///  
/// This will require the use of a edge detetection algorithim and some fillters, so if you can help 
/// and submit the code and the results of your processed samples to me it would be much apreciated.
///  
/// You won t get very far with fillters. What needs to be done is that you can do a couple of fillters. 
/// Each one extracting a different part of the image. For example just do a filter for the grey then the 
/// black. You then can then "add" the two images to each other.
