Intro
=====

Synthetica is a 'Look and Feel' for Swing and is based on Synth which is part of version 1.5 
of the Java2 Platform, Standard Edition. It provides components with rounded borders, 
shadowed popup menus, nice icons and a new, fresh look. Moreover it enables you to modify 
existing LAF's, or to create your own LAF only by editing a XML based configuration file. 
You don't have to write complex Java-GUI-Code, but you can integrate own code by your needs.
