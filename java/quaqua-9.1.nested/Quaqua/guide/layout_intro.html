  <h3>Creating Layouts for Mac OS X</h3>
  <p class="semiparagraph">You may want to read the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/XHIGLayout/chapter_19_section_1.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000360-TP9" target="_blank">Layout
    Examples</a> chapter of the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/" target="_blank">Apple
    Human Interface Guidelines (AHIG)</a> before you start creating layouts for
    Mac OS X.</p>
  <p class="semiparagraph">When you create layouts based on the AHIG guidelines
    using the Quaqua Look and Feel (Quaqua), it
    is important,
    that
    you are
    aware
    of the following issues:</p>
  <ul>
    <li class="semiparagraph">Mac OS X controls should always be center-equalized. On most other platforms,
      controls are often left justified. <br />
      Quaqua does not provide a facility for cross-platform layouts. That is,
      Quaqua does not automatically turn a left justified layout into a center-equalized
      layout. The task for
      creating
    center-equalized layouts is  yours.</li>
    <li class="semiparagraph">A Mac OS X control can come in up to three different size styles: full
      size, small and mini.<br />
      Quaqua supports the full size and the mall size style as a side effect
      of the font size. Set the font of a JComponent to Lucida Grande 13 for
      full size
      style,
      and to
      Lucida
      Grande
      11
    for the small size style. The mini size style is currently not supported.</li>
    <li class="semiparagraph">The AHIG describes the spacing around a control
      in pixels. The spacing is given for the visually perceived bounds of a
      control. These values need to be translated when used for Swing
      JComponents, because most Java layout managers need spacing values given
      for the
      clip
      bounds
      of a control.<br />
      Quaqua adds a margin of 3 pixels around the visually perceived
      bounds in
      order
      to
      accomodate
      for cast
      shadows and
      focus rings within the clip bounds of a JComponent.
      To translate AHIG spacing values into Quaqua spacing values, subtract 3
      pixels for spacings given between a control
      and
      its
      parent
      container,
      subtract
      6 pixels
      for
      spacing givens between adjacent
      controls. Sometimes this may result in negative spacing values, which is
      okay, because the margin of Quaqua is translucent.<br />
      Please note that only the Quaqua look and feel supports visual margins.
      All other look and feels, including the Apple look and feel, don't support
      visual margins, i.e. the amount of pixels that needs to be added or subtracted
    to the spacings given in the AHIG, is different for each control!</li>
    <li class="semiparagraph">The preferred spacing around a control depends
      on its relationship to other components on a form (related, unrelated,
      indented) and also
      on the type of the control and on its size style.<br />
      Quaqua together with LayoutStyle aware layout managers, such as GroupLayout,
    can automatically take into account most of these spacing guidelines.</li>
