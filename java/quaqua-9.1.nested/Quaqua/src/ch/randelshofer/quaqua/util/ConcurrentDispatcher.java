/**
 * Processes Runnable objects concurrently on a pool of processor threads.
 * The order in which the runnable objects are processed is not
 * necesseraly the same in which they were added to the dispatcher.
 * There is one thread pool per instance.
 * <p>
 * Design pattern used: Acceptor
 * Role in design pattern: EventCollector and EventProcessor
 * <p>
 * <b>Example</b>
 * <br>The following program prints "Hello World" on the
 * processor thread:
 * <pre>
 * // Create the Dispatcher.
 * ConcurrentDispatcher dispatcher = new ConcurrentDispatcher();
 *
 * // Create the Runnable object.
 * Runnable runner = new Runnable() {
 *     public void run()  {
 *         System.out.println("Hello World");
 *     }
 * };
 *
 * // Execute the Runnable objekt using the dispatcher.
 * dispatcher.dispatch(runner);
 * </pre>
 *
 * @author  Werner Randelshofer, Switzerland
 * @version 2.1 2009-06-01 Added dispose method.
 * <br>2.0 2002-04-07 dispatchLIFO added.
 * <br>1.0 2002-05-18 Created.
